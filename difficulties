Faced problem while using SerpAI and openAI despite installing all necessary packages and checking contents of secret.toml file , it still throws error.
To debug , changed the permission for secret.toml file, deleted and re-installed libraries therefore dashboard takes queries now and is functioning.
Checked deployment settings.

The error log indicates that there is a problem with accessing a secret key in a Streamlit application. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the error:

KeyError: The main issue is a KeyError indicating that the key 'SERPAPI_API_KEY' is not found in the st.secrets dictionary. This means that the application is trying to access a secret that has not been defined.

Traceback: The traceback shows the sequence of function calls leading to the error. The error originates in the search_entity function, specifically when trying to retrieve the API key using st.secrets["SERPAPI_API_KEY"].

Context: The error suggests that the application is likely set up to use Streamlit's secrets management feature to securely store sensitive information (like API keys). However, it seems that the required key has not been added to the secrets.toml file or has not been configured properly in the app settings.
